# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis Using Python

While transcriptional analysis by scRNA-seq continues to revolutionize the biological sciences, the demand for corresponding computational and statistical skills are becoming an essential skill for biologists. This course is designed for biologists with a basic skills of programming to confidently conduct the course and scRNA-seq data analysis. With a variety of scRNA-seq methodologies at our disposal, the challenge lies in using appropriate tools in the right way to draw meaningful biological conclusions. This course aims to provide an introduction to this complex landscape. In practical exercises with a real data set, you'll learn how to use computational methods and make sense of your results. Each day will start with lectures in the morning, followed by guided practical programming sessions in the afternoon to facilitate an experiential learning environment.

Day 1: Introduction to Single-cell RNA-Sequencing: including experimental design and processing raw reads to derive gene count matrices. The afternoon session will involve applied training on publicly accessible datasets and an orientation to the scverse ecosystem.

Day 2: Data Processing and Analysis: Instruction will cover quality control measures, data normalization, feature selection, batch correction and data integration, as well as methodologies for dimensionality reduction and clustering.

Day 3: Biological Data Interpretation incorporating both manual and automated cell type annotation, reference mapping, as well as differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses.

Day 4: Cellular Dynamics and Differentiation The session will encompass discussions on pseudotime analysis and RNA velocity, culminating in the capacity to trace and characterize cell lineage specification.

This structured, intensive course is designed to equip participants with the necessary skills to navigate and analyze single-cell RNA-sequencing data within a biological context. It is recommended that the participants have/acquire basic skills in Python.
